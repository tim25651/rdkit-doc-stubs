"""
rdkit.ML.Composite.BayesComposite moduleÂ¶
code for dealing with Bayesian composite models
For a model to be useable here, it should support the following API:

_ClassifyExample(example)_, returns a classification

Other compatibility notes:

To use _Composite.Grow_ there must be some kind of builder
functionality which returns a 2-tuple containing (model,percent accuracy).
The models should be pickleable
It would be very happy if the models support the __cmp__ method so that
membership tests used to make sure models are unique work.

    typical usage:

    grow the composite with AddModel until happy with it
    call AverageErrors to calculate the average error values
    call SortModels to put things in order by either error or count
