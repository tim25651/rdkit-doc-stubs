Module contentsÂ¶
Module containing an assortment of functionality for basic data structures.

At the moment the data structures defined are:
Bit Vector classes (for storing signatures, fingerprints and the like:

ExplicitBitVect: class for relatively small (10s of thousands of bits) ordense bit vectors.

SparseBitVect:   class for large, sparse bit vectors

DiscreteValueVect:   class for storing vectors of integers
SparseIntVect:       class for storing sparse vectors of integers
