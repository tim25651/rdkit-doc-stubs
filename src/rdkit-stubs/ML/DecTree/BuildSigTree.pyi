    Arguments

    examples: the examples to be classified.  Each example
    should be a sequence at least three entries long, with
    entry 0 being a label, entry 1 a BitVector and entry -1
    an activity value
    nPossibleRes: the number of result codes possible
    ensemble: (optional) if this argument is provided, it
    should be a sequence which is used to limit the bits
    which are actually considered as potential descriptors.
    The default is None (use all bits).
    random: (optional) If this argument is nonzero, it
    specifies the number of bits to be randomly selected
    for consideration at this node (i.e. this toggles the
    growth of Random Trees).
    The default is 0 (no random descriptor selection)
    metric: (optional) This is an _InfoTheory.InfoType_ and
    sets the metric used to rank the bits.
    The default is _InfoTheory.InfoType.BIASENTROPY_
    biasList: (optional) If provided, this provides a bias
    list for the bit ranker.
    See the _InfoTheory.InfoBitRanker_ docs for an explanation
    of bias.
    The default value is [1], which biases towards actives.

    maxDepth: (optional) the maximum depth to which the treewill be grown

    The default is -1 (no depth limit).

    useCMIM: (optional) if this is >0, the CMIM algorithm(conditional mutual information maximization) will be
    used to select the descriptors used to build the trees.
    The value of the variable should be set to the number
    of descriptors to be used.  This option and the
    ensemble option are mutually exclusive (CMIM will not be
    used if the ensemble is set), but it happily coexsts
    with the random argument (to only consider random subsets
    of the top N CMIM bits)

    The default is 0 (do not use CMIM)

    depth: (optional) the current depth in the tree
    This is used in the recursion and should not be set
    by the client.

    Returns

    a SigTree.SigTreeNode with the root of the decision tree"""
